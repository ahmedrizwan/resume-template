### Resume Template for Software Engineers

- Download resume.fig
- Import in Figma
- Edit to make it your own!

There are two boards, one has the components and the other one is the resume itself.
The resume board relies on a bunch of auto-layouts so that you don't have to manage layout & spacing manually.

If you like the template - you can support the work via:
